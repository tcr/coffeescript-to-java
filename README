c[_] Mug: (coffeescript) -> java

Mug statically compiles CoffeeScript into a single Java source file.

It's very much in its early stages, but you can have fun messing around
with lambdas, classes, and prototypical inheritance.

Instructions:
  Include 'mug.js'. Call Mug.compile(source) to get back compiled source.
  Sip, enjoy.

Notes:
  * print() and nanoTime() are currently the only built-in functions.
  * Source is compiled to a single source file with a run() command and a
    static main().
  * Originally called "Caffeine", but that name's too badass for an academic
    exercise.
  * Rhino can still crush a coffee mug.
